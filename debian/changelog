ros-hydro-play-motion (0.3.4-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * catch and show unexpected exceptions in main()
  * Refactor populateVelocities. Document it.
  * Propagate controller action state to internal API
    Fixes #15 <https://github.com/pal-robotics/play_motion/issues/15>
  * Refactor some stuff in play_motion.cpp
  * Refactor and document MoveJointGroup
  * Replace test_depend with build_depend
  * Use existing msg types for traj points. Refs #4 <https://github.com/pal-robotics/play_motion/issues/4>.
    - Move from the custom structs to trajectory_msgs types.
    - Waypoints can now have accelerations.

ros-hydro-play-motion (0.3.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Populate velocity data
    
      * Velocities are populated only for motions that don't specify velocities for at least one waypoint.
      * Good compromise: Smoother than Fritsch-Butland, while still allowing to hold position in equal consecutive waypoints (one of the heuristics we wanted).

ros-hydro-play-motion (0.3.0-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Add include dirs to unit tests
  * Document IsAlreadyThere service
  * Add service IsAlreadyThere
  * Changed error codes to follow ROS standard. SUCCEEDED should be 1 (so we don't have 0 as a real error code as it's a default value).
  * Return SUCCEEDED when everything went fine
  * use CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING in CMakeLists.txt
  * catkin-only version now
